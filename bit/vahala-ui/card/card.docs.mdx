import { ThemeProvider } from '@vahalawebdesign/vahala-ui.themes.theme-provider';
import { Card } from './card';

The `<Card />` component extends the [MUI Card](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-Card) including its theming, inline `sx` styling, and props.

The component is built utilizing MUI Card's subcomponents to be used as props in card usage.

The MUI `CardMedia` component accepts three props:

> 1. `cardMediaSrc`: HTML image `src` attribute
> 2. `cardMediaImage`: HTML image `href` attribute
> 3. `cardMediaTitle`: HTML title attribute for a11y

The MUI `CardContent` component accepts one prop and displays children below the content:

> 1.  `cardContent`: ReactNode

#### Accessibility

The component is fully accessible and customizable: supporting mouse, keyboard, and touch interactions, focus behavior, and ARIA props.

<Card cardTitle="Docs Card"></Card>

### Render Card
